# Ragnar Clarkson's Portfolio


## Introduction

I am a 22 year old programmer that enjoys writing code for gaming projects as well as creating models using blender.
I enjoy learning new ways to produce an outcome as well as experimenting with my own methods to see if I can produce a better way.

### Interests

I am interested in all things game including both code and design as i also really enjoy drawing which allows me to easily create quick models from my drawings in blender.

#### Current Projects

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

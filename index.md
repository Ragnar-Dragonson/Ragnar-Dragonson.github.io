# Introduction

I am a 22 year old programmer that enjoys writing code for gaming projects as well as creating models using blender.
I enjoy learning new ways to produce an outcome as well as experimenting with my own methods to see if I can create a better way.

## Interests

I am interested in all things game including both code and design as i also really enjoy drawing which allows me to easily create quick models from my drawings in blender. I also have a massive interest in historical warfare as well as fantasy warfare.
